# Problem Solving Projects

This repository contains my implementations for solving problems. Each game is solved using various algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* algorithm (using heuristics) and Genetic Algorithm.

## Knight Tour

The Knight's Tour is a classic chess problem where the objective is to move a knight to every square on a chessboard exactly once. The knight can only moves as letter L in the 4 directions. In my implementation, I utilized the genetic algorithm as an approch to determin a correct possible combinaison.

## Rush Hour Puzzle

Rush Hour Puzzle is a sliding block puzzle where the player must move vehicles within a congested parking lot to free a specific vehicle (in  the game i implemented it is the red car). The red car can only move in one direction. This game includes CSV configurations of various puzzles and implements both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* algorithm for solving them. The user can make his own CSV configuration and he can add obstacles by adding walls (#) to his CSV file configuration.

## Fifteen Puzzle

The Fifteen Puzzle, is a game where players arrange numbered square tiles in ascending order, with one tile missing. The objective is to reach the goal state by sliding tiles into the empty space. This implementation uses BFS to solve the puzzle efficiently.

## Connect Four
Connect Four is a strategic board game wherein the two players place their colored discs onto a grid, with the objective of forming a contiguous line of four discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This implementation provides players with a choice of three distinct difficulty levels : easy, medium, and hard as well as three diverse game modes: human vs. human, human vs. AI, and AI vs. AI. The implementation of this project can be found on the following [GitHub  repository](https://github.com/amineboucenna/Connect-Four).
